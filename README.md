# Libtrading

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/penberg/libtrading.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/penberg/libtrading)

Libtrading is a free and open source C library for trading securities, foreign
exchange and financial derivatives electronically. It implements market data,
order entry, drop copy, and related communications protocols used by exchanges
and alternative trading venues across the world.

The library is designed for high performance and robustness. Although latency
is very important in trading today's markets, achieving it it must not
jeopardise trading reliability.
